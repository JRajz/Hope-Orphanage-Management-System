<h3>“HOPE” is the best armory in the hands of a man to overcome his difficulties and to look forward to the future for progress and prosperity. It is an indisputable fact that every man has heart without which he cannot live. But having a kind heartedness is a virtue ordained by God on an individual. This depends upon the upbringing of a man and his environment.<br />The innate desire of a man is his kindness to the poor, many a time human beings yearn to do the right thing, especially when they have been blessed with abundance of wealth and wish to share it those with suffering mass. If a plant has to grow it needs water, air, sunshine, manure, favorable environment and above all a gardener to take care of it. In the same way mankind needs certain basic necessities.<br />In a recent survey india has found out that there are 40 million people who lack the basic amenities and education and above all Medicare. Many of the poor people living in urban area cannot afford the minimum of any of the basic needs. It is still bad in rural areas. Many of them are barely making a living and hardly get a meal a day. They do not have drinking water facility or housing facilities. They live in make shift straw houses, thatched huts, and wear rags for clothing, and have no footwear to wear.<br />With an objective of service to help the poor, especially to save the orphan children and disabled people regardless of caste, colour or creed, at the gross root level for the upliftment of their health and education,<font color="#0033FF"> HOPE CHILDREN'S HOME</font> was mooted.<br />
