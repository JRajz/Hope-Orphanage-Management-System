 Illiteracy means inability to read and write.Illiteracy is a curse because it is illiteracy that lowers down human being to the level of beast.Illiteracy is compared to darkness because it darkens individual’s vision,outlook,behavior and in a word,all aspect of life.It is the root cause of ignorance,superstition, backwardness,poverty and many more.Illiteracy is a  scar in our national life. Millions of people in our country are still in the darkness of illiteracy and ignoranceand not a little of our social and culture backwardness is due to this.</h3> 
<font size="+2" color="#0033FF"><u>Probleams Of Illiteracy</u></font><h3>The problem of illiteracy in India will not be solved only by providing education for the children. Illiteracy is rampant among the older generation of people, particularly in the rural areas Illiteracy refers to the state of being unable to read or write.Lack of literacy is a hurdle for overall development and well-being of this country. It weakens the backbone of our country.
 The problem can be solved only by recognition of the fact that education must be the primary responsibility of the State. It must be given a high priority. Voluntary efforts can only touch a fringe of the problem.Poverty is the main cause of illiteracy and vice versa.Similarly,underdevelopment causes illiteracy as much the same way illiteracy is the cause of underdevelopment.There are other causes too.Over population,financial and resource constraints.people’s superstition and negative attitude about education,lack of awareness etc are responsible for illiteracy.
Illiteracy generates hundreds of problems.Because of illiteracy,people don’t know how to earn well and how to spend well.As a result they can not come out of their poverty trap.Many do not have knowledge about food and nutrition.So they suffer from various kinds of diseases.In a word,illiteracy is the cause of poor socio-economic condition,high mortality rate,low life expectancy,child-labor and child marriage and high growth rate of population.If we want to build a happy and prosperous nation,if we want to stand in honor and dignity among the nations of the world and if we want to develop our living standard and living condition, we must remove illiteracy from the country.</h3>
