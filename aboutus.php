<h3><u><center>HOPE  CHILDRENS  HOME  A  GLANCE</center></u></h3></font><br /><br />


<h3>However, many of the poor living in urban area cannot afford the minimum of any of these basic needs. Many of these children barely make a living and hardly get one meal a day of their basic needs. They do not have water or housing facilities. They live to make shift straw houses and wear rags for cloths, and have no shoes at all for their feet. It is therefore with the aim of reaching these underprivileged people an offering them the basic necessities of life, through our charity.<br /><br />
 
“HOPE” is the best armory in the hands of a man to overcome his difficulties and to look forward to the future for progress and prosperity. It is an indisputable fact that every man has heart without which he cannot live. But having a kind heartedness is a virtue ordained by God on an individual. This depends upon the upbringing of a man and his environment.<br /><br />
 
The innate desire of a man is his kindness to the poor, many a time human beings yearn to do the right thing, especially when they have been blessed with abundance of wealth and wish to share it those with suffering mass. If a plant has to grow it needs water, air, sunshine, manure, favorable environment and above all a gardener to take care of it. In the same way mankind needs certain basic necessities.<br /><br />
 
In a recent survey HELPAGE INDIA has found out that there are 40 million people who lack the basic amenities and education and above all Medicare. Many of the poor people living in urban area cannot afford the minimum of any of the basic needs. It is still bad in rural areas. Many of them are barely making a living and hardly get a meal a day. They do not have drinking water facility or housing facilities. They live in make shift straw houses, thatched huts, and wear rags for clothing, and have no footwear to wear.<br /><br />
 
With an objective of service to help the poor, especially to save the orphan children and disabled people regardless of caste, colour or creed, at the gross root level for the upliftment of their health and education, HOPE CHILDRENS HOME was mooted.Then we formed HOPE CHILDRENS HOME.                         Most of the children are from the streets. They are brought up here with the help of the Police and child welfare committees. We are trying our maximum to provide our children with good education, nutritious food, proper clothing, safe shelter, and medical aid. Our main aim is to help our children to become independent and earn their living when they grow up and become fruitful people for God and people.

<br /><br />
